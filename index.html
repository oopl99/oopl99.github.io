           We are a group of four who believe that the death penalty is needed not only to help us create a safer world but also to balance the scale of ethics. The death penalty also come with several other benefits.
            Currently money is being used on prisons, when it could be used on more important tasks such as improving the quality of education and improving hospitals. The death penalty also helps to prevent overcrowding in             prisons. With about a 50% recidivism rate, many criminals will go back to committing crimes. Therfore, the death penalty helps us stay safe. For all these reasons we highly encourage you to support out cause.
