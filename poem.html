                We have created a poem which we believe portrays our opinion and emotions regarding the death penalty. By reading this poem you will hopefully better understand our position and join our cause.</br>
                </br>   
                A shot shatters the early morning silence</br>
A man collapses, his life oozing through his chest</br>
The crimson slows its relentless spread</br>
as the officers race in for the arrest</br>
And with them comes justice.</br>

THe gavel comes down on the bench</br>
the verdict comes, "Guilty, of murder in the first"</br>
He struggles as they lead him away, pinioned by guards,</br> 
his mind races, he fears for the worst,</br>
for he does not know when he will live or die.</br>

The death penalty must be restored</br>
for without it we pour our money down the drain</br>
We waste our money, time, and people on prisoners</br>
who should be dead to pay for the pain</br>
they caused-this is the justice they deserve.</br>

Our system as slow as time itself-</br>
we must bring forth some speed</br>
and carry out the executions because</br>
we use our resources on those without need-</br>
wasted on those whose lives mean nothing.</br>


They are in prison for a good reason-</br>
they have committed vile acts,</br>
so we must pursue justice no matter the costs.</br>
Now it's time to face the facts-</br>
we cannot leave murderers alive.</div></span>
