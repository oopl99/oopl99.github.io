                We have created a poem which we believe portrays our opinion and emotions regarding the death penalty. By reading this poem you will hopefully better understand our position and join our cause.</br>
                </br>   
                A shot shatters the early morning silence,</br>   
A man collapses, his life oozing through his chest,</br>   
The crimson tide weeps for the violence,</br>   
As the officers race after for his arrest.</br>   

And with them comes justice, the avenging angel,</br>
The verdict comes, "Guilty, of murder in the first"</br>   
As the gavel comes down on the table,</br>   
His mind races for he fears for the worst.</br>   

He struggles as they lead him away, </br>   
 Pinioned by guards, life in prison received</br>   .
People fear his acts and hopes he decays,</br>   
but life takes mercy and his punishment relieved.</br>   

After some years, from prison he escapes,</br>   
Once again out to sow terror on men.</br>   
Two he kills and one he rapes,</br>   
Death penalty would have solved it all then.</br>   

Wasting money on dangerous men,</br>   
Why should we help when they should be dead?</br>   
The risk of them hurting others again,</br>   
Could be eliminated if we executed them instead.</br>   

It’s evident the death penalty must be restored</br>   
Preventing the flood of millions a year.</br>   
With that reduced spending we can help the poor</br>   
Or fix education whose problems are severe.</br>   

They are in prison for enacting treason,</br>   
Or they have committed other vile acts,</br>   
So we must pursue justice for good reason</br>   
And in our society we must follow the facts.</br>   

This is justice, it’s what they deserve,</br>   
Such cruel crimes require punishment.</br>   
We need the death penalty to be preserved,</br>   
To protect all the citizens who are innocent.</br>   

Our system is as slow as a snail,</br>   
Costing extreme amounts for the mass.</br>   
Inefficiencies and injustice ooze out from its trail,</br>   
Mountains of trials and appeals to surpass.</br>   

Justice in the future will be fast,</br>   
No more debates and no more strife,</br>   
End of the crimes that leave us aghast,</br>   
With every death we celebrate life.</br>   

Once we clean up this mess, what is there to fear?</br>   
As a society risen from the depths of night,</br>   
The peace and prosperity is finally clear,</br>   
A great nation reborn, a wonderful sight.</br>
