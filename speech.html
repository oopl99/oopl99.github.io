            Thousands of murder victims lay still in their graves, in fields marked by death and mourning. Family and friends have come and gone, surrounding the tombs, lamenting for those who will never return. Even though the initial crime has long since passed, the victims’ families are still hurt year after year as they continue paying taxes, from which a large portion is used to support the prison system. This money is voraciously consumed by the murderers, who lie in their warm, well-lit cells, amply supplied with free food, free water, and free shelter for a lifetime, protected from the chaos, corruption, and crime of the world, much of which they helped create. $47,000 goes toward ONE inmate every year, $5,000 more than the annual cost of attending USC, one of the most prestigious universities in the world. The cost of supporting these murderers for their entire lifetimes has rapidly skyrocketed into both billions of dollars and millions of man-hours in the work that goes into guarding these prisoners. Why are we keeping them alive? What does good does it do for us? In reality, keeping them alive does us no good. 
	Today, 747 convicts rot in Death Row just here in California, awaiting justice that will never be dispensed with our current system. 126 had tortured their victims. 173 had slaughtered minors, and 44 had killed police officers. However, in 2006, a United States federal judge ordered a moratorium on all capital punishment in California, and since then the state has kept all prisoners on Death Row in high security prisons that cost $90,000 more per year per inmate (than the base of $47,000) for private cells and extra guards. $90,000 extra for these murderers, rapists, and other assorted convicts. $90,000 extra for victims and everyday citizens to pay. Is this justice? How is it fair?
	Our government is obligated to protect us, their citizens, from dangerous criminals. Merely jailing criminals creates chances for escape or for parole, then opportunities to commit more crime. We cannot afford to take any risks that involve gambling with the lives of any  citizens. In England, 1982, Andrew Dawson stabbed a ninety-one-year-old man twelve times and received a life sentence. After a mere 30 years in prison, he was released and presumed to be harmless to the public. Within a week, Dawson struck again, this time stabbing two neighbors to death. Two random, innocent lives had to be lost for a man who had originally received a life sentence to receive another “life sentence”. In a world with any morals, like ours today, we simply cannot accept deaths without rhyme or reason. Cases like these happen frequently, occurring much more often than we tend to believe. The risk of convicts relapsing into old habits is more than enough to justify the punishment of death. This occurrence, known as recidivism, is quite commonplace among paroled murderers. In fact, more than three-quarters of released criminals are rearrested within five years of leaving prison. This shows there is an inordinately high risk that a murderer will be released on parole or escape from prison to decimate more people’s lives. By eliminating one life, we can ensure the safety of many innocent citizens. We must place the good of the many over the good of the few. 
To truly seek justice for the victims, the justice system needs to establish a well-maintained balance of crime and punishment. Right now, the system is leaning towards the criminals, who will receive shorter sentences for relatively serious crimes. When crime escalates to murder, the justice system should not be lenient towards these criminals. Let justice bring hope to the hearts of the righteous, and bring terror to the wicked who would exploit others. The punishment should at least match the crime, so the murderers should receive the death sentence.
	The death penalty needs to be reinstated. To eliminate the inequality with the justice system in California, we need to reinstate capital punishment. By executing murderers and rapists, we are saving money. We are saving lives. We are saving the world from those who would use crime to benefit themselves. The simple fact is, it could be any one of our family members who is murdered tomorrow. If we continue our journey without questioning the justice in our society, we endanger countless people with the threat of sudden death.  Since these monsters have taken the lives of others, justice demands that their lives be taken away as well.
